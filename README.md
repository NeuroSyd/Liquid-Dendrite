# Liquid-Dendrite Model

This model created by Herbozo Contreras, L. F integrates both Liquid Spiking Neurons and Dendrite Spiking Neurons to create a low-memory, edge-deployable algorithm for efficient seizure detection.

The main code for training can be found on main_rnn_denri_layer1_bptt.py 

The different Spiking Neurons being used can be found in SNN_Layers.
